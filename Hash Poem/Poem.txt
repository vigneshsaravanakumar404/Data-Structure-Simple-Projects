Oh HashMap, how thy keys and values entwine,
A perfect union, bound by code and fate.
Thy entries, stored in memory divine,
A treasure trove of data, sealed and great.
Thy methods, simple yet powerful, keep
Our data safe and accessible with ease.
With put and get, thy secrets we can reap,
And traverse thy structures with such ease.
Thy performance, too, is quite impressive,
With constant time for lookups, we're astound.
Thy simplicity and speed possessive,
Thy value, in our hearts, forever bound.
Oh HashMap, thy worth cannot be measured,
In code and data, thy worth is un-treasured.
